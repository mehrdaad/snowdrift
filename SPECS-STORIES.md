# Specs - User Stories 
*for https://snowdrift.coop*

> ***Understanding this document***
> 
> Collaboratively creating software presents many challenges, not the least of
which is agreeing on what software is actually being created. This page is a
record of what agreements have been made and implemented. It is a **living document**.
The rest of this section will describe its format and contents: namely, user stories.
> 
> We try to focus our discussion on individual features by motivating them with
user stories. By using the format **" As a ____ , I want ____ so that ____ "**, we can
have a concrete discussion about *who* is using the feature, *what* it provides,
and *why* it is useful. Deciding on a user story is only the first step, of
course, and can certainly be contentious in its own right. We can always return
to it, however, to reign in lengthy and far-ranging tangents while collaborating
on future plans.
> 
> The user stories for the website are grouped under the page on which the relevant
feature exists. This is just for ease of lookup. User stories define which pages
existâ€”not the other way around.

###  / (Welcome page)
-  **As a** visitor, **I want** to read an introduction to the website **so that** I can
   familiarize myself with the platform and its goals.

###  /how-it-works
-  (Rationale) **As a** visitor, **I want** to read an introduction to the mechanism **so
   that** I can familiarize myself with how it works and what will happen when I
   make a pledge.

###  /about
-  (Rationale) **As a** visitor, **I want** to read a description of the Snowdrift.coop
   ORGANIZATION (i.e. in the guise of the entity that runs the platform) **so that**
   I can learn about the people who run the Snowdrift.coop website and how they
   operate.

###  /p/snowdrift
-  **As a** visitor, **I want** to see information about the project's goals and
   purpose **so that** I can decide if I want to support it.
-  **As a** visitor, **I want** to see the crowdmatch status for the Snowdrift.coop
   PROJECT (i.e. in the guise of a project on the platform: /p/snowdrift) **so that** 
   I can understand the effect of adding my pledge.
-  **As a** user, **I want** a pledge button on the project page **so that** I can become a
   patron.
-  **As a** patron, **I want** an unpledge button on the project page **so that** I can
   unpledge if I no longer think the project needs my support.

###  /dashboard
-  (Rationale) **As a** patron, **I want** to see an overview of my pledges **so that** I
   feel in control of my impact and contributions.
-  **As an** early-stage patron, **I want** to see a history of crowdmatches (with
   totals) **so that** I can track the progress towards the first donation payment.

###  /payment-info
-  **As a** user, **I want** to read an explanation of the payment-info process, **so that**
   I know what purpose it serves and what the next steps will be.
    -  This explanation is self-contained, but also follows from the text on the
       welcome page.
-  **As a** user, **I want** to be notified when a page uses proprietary javascript **so that** 
   I know Snowdrift.coop has made an intentional compromise.

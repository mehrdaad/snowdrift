  <h2>About Snowdrift.coop
  <p>
    We're building a sustainable funding platform for public goods â€” those
    things that everyone can use and share without limitations. Using our
    innovative crowdmatching pledge, we create a network effect where we all
    work together to support free/libre/open projects of all sorts.
